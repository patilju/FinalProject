## Online Pharmacy System

### Online Pharmacy System

### Project Overview:

The main purpose of our application is that it provides customers a platform to order medicines online from a store. The solution is convenient and very similar to any eCommerce site where people can browse for the medicines they want to order. Filter the search based on various metrics, order tracking and so much more to make the customer experience superior on the site.


Key Functionalities:

1)	This Application should be able to register the people (customers) who wants to buy medicines from the pharmacy
2)	All the people should enter the valid data required for registration as a customer.
3)	As an admin this application should also be able to register data for Pharmacy presents in that region.
4)	Once a customer places their order the vendor gets the order details, verifies the submitted prescription, and processes the order and the medicine gets delivered to the customer’s doorstep.


Working: 

This application consists of Homepage which consists of login option where you can login using the credentials. After logging in you will be redirected to the “Admin Panel”. This admin Panel consists of three enterprises “Manage Customers”, “Manage Pharmacy”, “Manage Supplier”. We can choose any one role and on behalf of them we can create, view and update the data accordingly. After logging into the system, you will be authorized with the admin rights and you can make required changes in the data. After making the changes we can logout from the system using the log out option present on the home page of the application.

Manager Customer is displayed as the first enterprise which will redirect you to a page where we can add new customers, view them, update and delete the existing customers.

The second enterprise in the system is Manage Pharmacy. This will redirect you the page where we can add new pharmacy or update or delete the existing pharmacy. While adding the new pharmacy it will ask for few details like pharmacy name or address.

The third enterprise is Manage Suppliers. This will redirect you the page where we can add data for new suppliers which will supply medicines to the existing pharmacies, delete and update the existing suppliers if required.
